# ðŸŽ‰MultiTQ
This is the code for the paper [Multi-granularity Temporal Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.637) (Chen et al., ACL 2023).

MULTITQ is a large-scale dataset featuring ample relevant facts and multiple temporal granularities.

#### Architecture of MultiQA

## Dataset and pretrained models

MultiTQ dataset can be found in ./data folder. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/czy1999/MultiTQ.git

cd ./MultiTQ/data
unzip Dataset.zip

cd ../MultiQA/models
unzip Models.zip
```



## Running the code

MultiQA, a strong baseline to
handle multi-granularity TKGQA
```bash
cd MultiQA 
python ner_task.py
python ./train_qa_model.py --model multiqa
 ```


Please explore more argument options in train_qa_model.py.




The implementation is based on TempoQR in [TempoQR: Temporal Question Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05785) and their code from https://github.com/cmavro/TempoQR. You can find more installation details there.
We use TComplEx KG Embeddings as implemented in https://github.com/facebookresearch/tkbc.
